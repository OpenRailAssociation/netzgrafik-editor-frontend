# Roadmap

## Goals on the roadmap

This roadmap description outlines the strategic goals to improve the Netzgrafik-Editor's business
value. It serves as a guiding document that aligns goals on the roadmap in the short and long term
and outlines more general ideas.

### Short-term goals on the roadmap:

| Version | Feature | More Info | Issues |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.9 |  Origin-Destination-Matrix: Travel time matrix for different routes / visualisation & analytics. | https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/issues/126  |  [Open Issues / Tasks](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AOrigin-Destination-Matrix) |
| 2.10 | One-way trainruns | https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/issues/438 |   [Open Issues / Tasks](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Asymmetric%20times%22) |
| 2.11 | Asymmetric times | https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/issues/421 |   [Open Issues / Tasks](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Asymmetric%20times%22) |
| ? |  Check conformity of business rules |  | |
| ? |  Comparision of variants | | |
| ? | Merge different variants | | [Partially implemented](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/blob/main/documentation/Merge_Netzgrafik.md)|

### Long-term goals on the roadmap:

- **Integration in existing landscape of tools:**
  Integrate the developed tools with existing
  timetabling, demand simulation, and forecasting tools.

- **Compare existing demand forecast with designed supply:**
  Analyze and compare the forecasted demand with the planned supply.

- **Automatically derive timetables from demand:**
  Develop algorithms to automatically generate timetables based on the
  predicted demand.

- **Circulation and requirements for rolling stock:**
  Evaluate the circulation and rolling stock requirements based on the
  planned timetables.

- **Actual/target comparison of mesoscopic infrastructure:**
  Compare the actual/existing infrastructure with the target infrastructure

## Ideas for the roadmap:

Efficiently design and compare different variants of multimodal timetables/concepts.
Gain insights by extracting the entered information through smart projection and analytics
capabilities.
These goals and ideas indicate a focus on improving travel time analysis, ensuring compliance with
business rules, and integrating various tools for better planning and decision-making. Additionally,
the ideas emphasize the importance of efficient design, data analysis, and gaining insights from the
collected information.
