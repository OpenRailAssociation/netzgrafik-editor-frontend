### Long-term Goals on the Roadmap

- **Integration into the existing tool landscape:**  
  Integrate the developed tools with timetabling, demand simulation, and forecasting systems.

- **Compare demand forecasts with designed supply:**  
  Analyze and compare forecasted demand with planned supply.

- **Automatically derive timetables from demand:**  
  Develop algorithms to automatically generate timetables based on predicted demand.

- **Circulation and rolling stock requirements:**  
  Evaluate circulation and rolling stock needs based on planned timetables.

- **Actual vs. target comparison of mesoscopic infrastructure:**  
  Compare existing infrastructure with target infrastructure.

## Ideas for the Roadmap

- Efficiently design and compare different variants of multimodal timetables and concepts.
- Gain insights by extracting entered information through smart projection and analytics capabilities.
- Focus on improving travel time analysis, ensuring compliance with business rules, and integrating tools for better planning and decision-making.
- Emphasize efficient design, data analysis, and deriving insights from collected information.
