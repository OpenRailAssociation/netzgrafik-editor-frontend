# Contributors

Many thanks to all contributors for their commitment and work, without which this project would not
have been possible. Thank you for your current and future contribution!

## Special thanks to

The (core) team consistently focused on an interactive planning tool with a minimum of complexity.
This was only possible with a coherent UX design concept from the very first draft and its
consistent implementation. However, the most important success factor in the implementation and
improvement of the tool was and is an interdisciplinary, committed team. Many thanks to the
outstanding, interdisciplinary, creative work of the individual team members. Such a complex project
can only succeed with the help of good teamwork.
