# Contributors

Many thanks to all contributors for their engagement and contribution, without which this project
would not have been possible. Thank you for your current and future contribution!

## Special thanks to

It all started with the idea of creating an interactive planning tool with minimal complexity
and maximum usability. To achieve this ambitious goal, a comprehensive UX design concept was
developed and consistently implemented. However, even the best concept can only be successful when
an interdisciplinary team contributes its entire knowledge to the conception, implementation, and
continuous improvement. Therefore, special thanks go to the exceptional, interdisciplinary, and
creative collaboration of all participants from the very beginning - from the idea to the finished
product.
