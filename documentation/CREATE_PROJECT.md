### Become creative (start editing)

#### Clear template Netzgrafik

The editor opens the newly created Netzgrafik. The new Netzgrafik contains some initially created
nodes
from which users can draw trainruns with their sections. In most projects these nodes are not
required. If so press (ctrl+a) to select all elements of the current Netzgrafik and press 'delete'
to
remove them.
