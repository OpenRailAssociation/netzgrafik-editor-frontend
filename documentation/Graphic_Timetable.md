## Show graphic timetable (Streckengrafik)

To display the graphical timetable, a train must be selected. It defines the corridor along which
the graphical representation will be created.
This corridor is shown on the horizinal axes of the chart. The time is displayed on the other axis.
To do this, first select a train and then click on the "Graphical Timetable" icon in the menu bar at
the bottom.
The graphical timetable view will open, displaying the train's route and timeline.
