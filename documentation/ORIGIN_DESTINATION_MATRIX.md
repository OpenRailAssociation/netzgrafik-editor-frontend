# Origin Destination Matrix

The Origin Destination Matrix shows the optimized travel time (total cost) between each pair of nodes.

The optimized travel time includes a fixed penalty (5 minutes) for each transfer, but the Origin Destination Matrix also shows the corresponding effective travel time and number of transfers.

## Filtering

If some nodes are selected, then the Origin Destination Matrix will only show results between these nodes (but other nodes may be used to compute paths).

The Origin Destination Matrix will only show results between visible nodes (but other nodes may be used to compute paths).

The Origin Destination Matrix will only use visible trainruns to compute paths.

## Results

There are two ways to visualize the results:

- From the export menu (left), the results can be exported as a CSV file.
- From the tool bar (bottom), the results can be displayed in the Origin Destination Matrix view.

The Origin Destination Matrix view computes the results once (when opened). It allows to color the matrix based on a chosen palette and a field (right). It also displays a chosen field (bottom left).
