## Trainrun

### Create new trainrun

To create a new train route, proceed as follows:

- Select the inner node: Click the left mouse button on the inner node from which you want to start
  the trainrun section.
- Connect the node: Hold down the left mouse button and drag the connecting line to the other node
  that you want to connect the train section to.
- Configure the train route: Give the new train an appropriate name and specify the necessary
  details, such as train number or other relevant information.

> **Note:** Importantly, you don't have to select a train route - otherwise, just edit the selected
> train route instead of creating a new one.

### Rerouting trainrun sections

To reroute a train, follow these steps:

- Select the train to be rerouted: Use the left mouse click to select the train that you want to
  reroute.
- Drag and drop sections on the node: After selecting the train, you can rearrange sections of the
  train by dragging and dropping the small pins on the nodes. This allows you to reassign sections
  to different parts of the train's route.
- Redirect train sections: If you want to redirect (reroute) two sections, you can easily do so by
  clicking and holding the left mouse button on the hexagon button on the node. Then, drag and drop
  the hexagon button, and both train sections will move together. Drag the sections to a different
  node to reroute them.

### Toggle stop / non-stop at node (trainrun transition)

To switch a train from a stop to a non-stop at a node, follow these steps:

- Select the train: Ensure that the train you want to modify is selected. You can do this by
  left-clicking on the train.
- Access train transitions: Locate the hexagon button within the node representation. This button
  signifies train transitions (Stop/Non-Stop).

## Show graphic timetable (Streckengrafik)

To display the graphical timetable, a train must be selected. It defines the corridor along which
the graphical representation will be created.
This corridor is shown on the horizinal axes of the chart. The time is displayed on the other axis.
To do this, first select a train and then click on the "Graphical Timetable" icon in the menu bar at
the bottom.
The graphical timetable view will open, displaying the train's route and timeline.
