## Filters

In the network Netzgrafik-Editor, the "What You See Is What You Get" principle applies.
This means that everything you have displayed will be drawn, analyzed, and can be edited.
Therefore, the filtering function plays a crucial role. It offers a wide range of possibilities,
from simple filtering to very complex and user-specific settings, allowing you to create complex
views.

### Filterable labels

Users can add user-defined labels to trains, notes, and nodes.
These labels, also known as filterable labels, can be used to create custom filters based on
user-specific criteria.

Filterable labels can be grouped and sorted, making it easy to create new filter groups.
Within a filter group, such as train category or frequency, complex filters can be quickly created.

To do this, you need to switch to the editing tool and navigate to the filterable labels,
specifically the filterable nodes if you want to edit nodes. In the filterable nodes section,
labels can be sorted within a group using drag and drop. The sorting will be saved.

Additionally, a new group can be created by using the "+" button,
and a group can be deleted using the "-" button. Filter labels in the deleted group
will automatically be moved back to the default group after deletion.

When clicking on a label (button), a dialog window opens with three functions: rename, delete, and
apply the label globally or to all nodes, trains, or notes.

- Rename: Allows you to change the name of the label.
- Delete: Removes the label. If applied globally, it will be removed from all nodes, trains, or
  notes.
- Apply globally: Transfers the label to all nodes, trains, or notes. This means that the label will
  be added to all existing and future nodes, trains, or notes.

These functions provide flexibility in managing and customizing labels according to your needs.
