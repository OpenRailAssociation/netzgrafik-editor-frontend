Connections can be easily created by following these steps:

- Select the train for which you want to create a connection.

Instead of re-routing the train, you can use a pin where the trainrun is connected to a node.
To create the connection, drag and drop the pin from one node to another.

When dragging within a node, the line will appear dashed, and small circles will indicate all
possible connections.
Drag the line to the desired circle using drag and drop, and the connection will be drawn.

### Delete connections

If you want to delete a connection, simply release the pin outside a node.

### Delete connections with the help of Perlenkette

By using the Perlenkette, connections can be easily deleted. In the Perlenkette, you can see all the
connections
for a selected train. To delete a connection, follow these steps:

- In the pearls view, locate the connections for the selected train which should be deleted.
- Click on the connections to mark them. (Clicking again removes the marking.)

Once the connections are marked, press the "Delete" key (DEL) to delete all the marked connections.
