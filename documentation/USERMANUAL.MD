# Netzgrafik-Editor User Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of its key features and instructions on how to interact with
the editor effectively.

Key Features

1. **Network Creation:**
   The Netzgrafik-Editor enables users to create network graphics from scratch.
   Users can define nodes, trainruns and attributes to build a comprehensive Netzgrafik
   representation.

2. **Node and Trainrun Customization:**
   Users can customize nodes, trainrun with its sections and connections in the network graphics.
   This includes changing the appearance (trainrun category, frequency), labeling, and adding
   additional information such as connections.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**
   The editor offers a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to easily position
   nodes
   which impacts directly visual the routing of the edges (trainruns) and transitions and
   connections
   within the node. This intuitive feature simplifies the creation and adjustment of network layout.

4. **Advanced Editing:**
   Users can perform advanced editing operations such as copy (Ctrl+C), paste (Ctrl+V),
   duplicate (Ctrl+D), delete (Del) and undo (Ctrl+Z) in multiple steps - either using the
   standard Ctrl+z key command or with help of the version history. These editing features make
   management easier to process complex network structures efficiently. User don't need to
   explicitly save the latest changes. The system save it automatically.

5. **Collaboration and Sharing:**
   The Netzgrafik-Editor provides collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work on the  
   same network graphic simultaneously. Users can share their work with others, track changes,
   and collaborate seamlessly.
