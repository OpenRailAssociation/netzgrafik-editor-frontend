## Introduction

This document provides an overview of its key features and instructions on how to interact with
the editor effectively.

Key Features

1. **Network Creation:**
   The Netzgrafik-Editor enables users to create network graphics from scratch.
   Users can define nodes, trainruns and attributes to build a comprehensive Netzgrafik
   representation.

2. **Node and Trainrun Customization:**
   Users can customize nodes, trainrun with its sections and connections in the network graphics.
   This includes changing the appearance (trainrun category, frequency), labeling, and adding
   additional information such as connections.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**
   The editor offers a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to easily position
   nodes
   which impacts directly visual the routing of the edges (trainruns) and transitions and
   connections
   within the node. This intuitive feature simplifies the creation and adjustment of network layout.

4. **Advanced Editing:**
   Users can perform advanced editing operations such as copy (Ctrl+C), paste (Ctrl+V),
   duplicate (Ctrl+D), delete (Del) and undo (Ctrl+Z) in multiple steps - either using the
   standard Ctrl+z key command or with help of the version history. These editing features make
   management easier to process complex network structures efficiently. User don't need to
   explicitly save the latest changes. The system save it automatically.

5. **Collaboration and Sharing:**
   The Netzgrafik-Editor provides collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work on the  
   same network graphic simultaneously. Users can share their work with others, track changes,
   and collaborate seamlessly.

## New Project/Variant

### Create a new Variant within an Project

To create a new variant of a project, all you have to do is click the + and enter a name. You have
already created a new variant in the project.

## Trainruns

### Create new trainrun

To create a new train route, proceed as follows:

- Select the inner node: Click the left mouse button on the inner node from which you want to start
  the trainrun section.
- Connect the node: Hold down the left mouse button and drag the connecting line to the other node
  that you want to connect the train section to.
- Configure the train route: Give the new train an appropriate name and specify the necessary
  details, such as train number or other relevant information.

> **Note:** Importantly, you don't have to select a train route - otherwise, just edit the selected
> train route instead of creating a new one.
